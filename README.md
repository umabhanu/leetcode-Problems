1. (Solution file) Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).
    Return the running sum of nums.
    
  2. problem 2: Given the array nums consisting of 2n elements in the form [x1,x2,...,xn,y1,y2,...,yn].
    return the array in the form [x1,y1,x2,y2,...,xn,yn].
    
  3.  Problem 3: Given an array of integers nums. A pair (i,j) is called good if nums[i] == nums[j] and i < j. Return the number of good pairs.
  
  4. Problem4: Given the array nums, for each nums[i] find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each nums[i] you have to count the number of valid j's such that j != i and nums[j] < nums[i]. Return the answer in an array.


5. problem 5: We are given a list nums of integers representing a list compressed with run-length encoding.
Consider each adjacent pair of elements [freq, val] = [nums[2*i], nums[2*i+1]] (with i >= 0).  For each such pair, there are freq elements with value val concatenated in a sublist. Concatenate all the sublists from left to right to generate the decompressed list.
Return the decompressed list.

6. s1:  finding smallest among ten numbers without using arrays

7. sum of all array elements
8. Problem 10: Given an array of integers sorted in ascending order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.
Example: Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]
Input: nums = [5,6,7,8,9,10], target = 7
Output: [2,2]

8. Anagram: compare two strings and print whether they are anagram to each other or not.
