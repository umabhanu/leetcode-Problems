1. (Solution file) Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).
    Return the running sum of nums.
    
  2. problem 2: Given the array nums consisting of 2n elements in the form [x1,x2,...,xn,y1,y2,...,yn].
    return the array in the form [x1,y1,x2,y2,...,xn,yn].
    
  3.  Problem 3: Given an array of integers nums. A pair (i,j) is called good if nums[i] == nums[j] and i < j. Return the number of good pairs.
  
  4. Problem4: Given the array nums, for each nums[i] find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each nums[i] you have to count the number of valid j's such that j != i and nums[j] < nums[i]. Return the answer in an array.
